        <h2>Description</h2>
        <strong><em>Sinigang</em></strong> is a 
        Filipino soup or stew characterized
         by its sour and savory taste. It is most often 
         associated with tamarind (Filipino: <em>
         sampalok</em>), although it can use other sour 
         fruits and leaves as the souring agent such as 
         unripe mangoes or rice vinegar. It is one of 
         the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine. 
         <p>This soup, like most Filipino dishes, is usually 
         accompanied by rice.</p>
