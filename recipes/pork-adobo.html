        <strong>Philippine <em>adobo</em></strong> 
        (from Spanish <em>adobar</em>: "marinade," "sauce" 
        or "seasoning") is a popular Filipino dish and
        cooking process in Philippine cuisine. 
        <p>In its base form, meat, seafood, or vegetables 
        are first browned in oil,
        and then marinated and simmered in vinegar, 
        salt and/or soy sauce, and garlic. 
        It has occasionally been considered the 
        <em>unofficial national dish</em> 
        in the Philippines.</p>
